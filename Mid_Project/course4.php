<h1> <b><u>Cybersecurity</u></b></h1> 
       <p><b>The Cybersecurity Specialization covers the fundamental concepts underlying the construction of secure systems, from the hardware to
	   the software to the human-computer interface, with the use of cryptography to secure interactions. These concepts are illustrated with 
	   examples drawn from modern practice, and augmented with hands-on exercises involving relevant tools and techniques. Successful
	   participants will develop a way of thinking that is security-oriented, better understanding how to think about adversaries and how to build 
	   systems that defend against them.with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive impairments.
